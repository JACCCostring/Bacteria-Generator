<b># Bacteria Generator</b>

This Project is focus on View-Design only for Education perposes not a real application, 
but it could be used for that was well with some code modifications. Software can generate Bacteries
and stop them on any moment, if a Bacteria get in touch with another/others then it can re-produce and the 
production is tracked by a container and then later it can be retrieved by a bacteria tracker feature added 
implemented with multithread and the bacteria reading with the tracker can read by 500 bacteria on each read,
instead of 8,000 or 27,000 bacteries tracked then it will read by 500 bacteries on each iteration(read).
